## A quick preface üìù
This talk is a sample teaching presentation.

The task: *A short teaching presentation (5-10 mins) explaining some topic of my choice suitable for a second or third year undergraduate Data Science course.*

I have geared this talk to a third year class with the following assumptions:
- this topic would be fairly early in the course (Week 1 or 2),
- students have had exposure to programming in R & RStudio and using the `tidyverse`, and
- in class we have already discussed some ideas around professional practice, communication and collaboration.

.small[*This presentation is based on content I developed and taught in STA303: Methods of Data Analysis II at the University of Toronto.*]

## Learning outcomes

#### Specific
- Describe the features of good reproducible examples and when and why we need them.
- Create a basic reprex in R.

#### Course level

In a course with a small number of overarching learning outcomes, this topic would likely come under something of this kind:

- Understand and implement professional collaboration and communication practices appropriate for data scientists.

## What is a {repr}oducible {ex}ample?

--
**reprex** (noun) An example that someone else can reproduce.
<br>

--
<br>
Specifically, it is a **minimal example** needed for someone helping you to reproduce an error or other behaviour you would like them to recreate on their own machine.*

.footnote[*This is especially helpful with the rise of online and hybrid work!] 

--

<br>
<br>
Additionally, sometimes when we say "reprex" we mean `reprex` (the package) or `reprex::reprex()` (a function within the package)

[reprex.tidyverse.org](https://reprex.tidyverse.org/)


---
## Why should you care about creating reproducible examples?

* Useful **professional skill** for those working with R and other programming languages in further study and future employment. 
  - These concepts transferable to programming in any language. Learning how to ask for help is an evergreen skill.
  - Useful for: 
      * Asking a question on [community.rstudio.com](https://community.rstudio.com/) or [stackoverflow.com](https://stackoverflow.com/).
      * Report a bug on [github.com](https://github.com/).
      * Collaborate on Slack, Discord or in email.

* Useful NOW to help *us* help **YOU** on Ed Discussion.

* The process of preparing a reprex forces you to think about your code in a specific way that can help you spot the problem without actually having to ask anyone else.*


.footnote[*This literally happened to me about 2 hours before preparing this slide for the first time!]

## The philosophy of a good reprex

.large[
* Reprex code must **run** ‚Äî no faking it, make sure you can run it and that it demonstrates the issue
* Others shouldn't *have* to run it ‚Äî someone familiar with R might be able to read the code and output and immediately understand what is going on
* Should be easy for others to copy + paste + run

.purple[.center[.large[**Must run. Doesn't have to be run. Easy to run.**]]]


---
## Data dos and don'ts

**Use the simplest dataset possible**, almost NEVER your actual data. `iris` and `mtcars` are classics.
- This is a great challenge to help you check if the issue is with your code or your data setup.

- Furthermore, can your *data* even be shared? 
      * This may have **privacy/commercial sensitivity** implications.
      * It may just be *inconvenient* for the person/people helping you to have a large dataset.

## Homework tasks


.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[1 Watch Jenny Bryan's video]

[Jenny Bryan](https://jennybryan.org/about/) is a bit of a hero of mine, and this was even BEFORE I knew she was one of the developers of the `reprex` package.

I think the whole video is excellent, but at minimum, please watch the following time intervals:

1. 0:00 - 7:20 (background and initial demo) <br>
2. 14:08 - 29:48 (philosophy and examples)

.highlight[The video and slides are on this page: https://reprex.tidyverse.org/articles/articles/learn-reprex.html]

]
.panel[.panel-name[2 Post on Ed Discussion]

There is a Thread on Ed Discussion called **reprex practice**. Go through the steps I demonstrated today on your own and .question[post the result as a comment].

.question[Identify and explain what is causing the error]

üìÖ .highlight[Complete this by 5 PM Friday to earn the point top-up for this week's tasks.]
