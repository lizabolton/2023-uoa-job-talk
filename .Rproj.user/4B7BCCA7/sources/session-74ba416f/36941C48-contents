## A quick preface üìù
This talk is a sample teaching presentation.

The task: *A short teaching presentation (5-10 mins) explaining some topic of my choice suitable for a second or third year undergraduate Data Science course.*

I have geared this talk to a third year class with the following assumptions:
- students have had exposure to programming in R & RStudio and using the `tidyverse`,
- this topic would be fairly early in the course (Week 1 or 2), and
- in class we have already discussed some ideas around professional practice, communication and collaboration.

## What is a reproducible example?

--
Well, it is an example that someone else can reproduce.
<br>

--
<br>
Specifically, it is a **minimal example** needed for someone helping you to reproduce an error or other behaviour you would like them to recreate on their own machine*.

.footnote[*This is especially helpful with the rise of online and hybrid work!] 



---
## Why should you care about creating reproducible examples?

* Useful **professional skill** for those working with R and other programming languages in further study and future employment 
  - These concepts transferable to programming in any language.
  - You will continue to learn updated/new functions, if not whole new languages in your career. Learning how to ask for help is an evergreen skill.

* Useful NOW to help us help YOU on Ed Discussion.

* The process of preparing a reprex forces you to think about your code in a specific way that can help you spot the problem without actually having to ask anyone else.*


.footnote[*This literally happened to me about 2 hours before preparing this slide for the first time!]

---
## Other things to know

* Please try to use use reprexes when asking for help on Ed Discussion!
  * ‚ùå Screenshots
  * ‚ùå Upside down photos of computer screens taken from phones üò≠
  * ‚úÖ Code I could copy and run myself  + what your output looks like 

* If you've already installed the `tidyverse` package, `reprex` is installed will be loaded whenever we run `library(tidyverse)`.

* You won‚Äôt have to worry about the data side of reprexes as much for this course, as in almost all cases we will all be working with the same data. But! It is a key skill if you will be working with data and programming languages in the future.


---
## Future data considerations

- Can your *data* be shared? 
  - This may have **privacy/commercial sensitivity** implications
  - It may just be *inconvenient* for the person/people helping you to have a large dataset
  
- Can you replicate your problem with an inbuilt dataset? E.g., `starwars` in the `tidyverse`, `iris` or `mtcars` in base R

## Homework tasks


.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[1 Watch Jenny Bryan's video]

[Jenny Bryan](https://jennybryan.org/about/) is a bit of a hero of mine, and this was even BEFORE I knew she was one of the developers of the `reprex` package.

I think the whole video is excellent, but at minimum, please watch the following time intervals:

1. 0:00 - 7:20 (background and initial demo) <br>
2. 14:08 - 29:48 (philosophy and examples)

.highlight[The video and slides are on this page: https://reprex.tidyverse.org/articles/articles/learn-reprex.html]

]
.panel[.panel-name[2 Post on Ed Discussion]

There is a Thread on Ed Discussion called **reprex practice**. Go through the steps I demonstrated today on your own and post the result as a comment.

.highlight[Deadline: Complete this by 5 PM Friday to earn the point top-up for this week's tasks.]
